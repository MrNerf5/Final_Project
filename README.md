Final Project about AI tools to help in coding

use ChatGTP for as a starter to create a template for a rpg game in python 
Also use to talk about the benefits of AI 

Python 
https://www.brookings.edu
https://www.britannica.com/
ChatGTP.com
https://online.uc.edu/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-benefits/

I use ChatGTP for as a start and that a guide for to edit the code
then I made two files one of the orginal and the other a copy
I edit the copy and see what ChatGTP can bring different results
but I also use the original to help edit or add more for the copy since it was easy to use as a refernce 
then I work on the final touches and save them
